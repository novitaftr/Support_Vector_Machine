### Support Vector Machine (SVM) for Regression

In this project, we will explore Support Vector Machine (SVM) for Regression using the provided dataset homework.csv.

Instructions:
1. Dataset: Open the homework.csv file to access the dataset.
2. Data Preparation: Define the predictor variable (X) and the dependent/target variable (y) from the dataset.
3. Model Training: Train four different SVM regression models as provided in the code.
4. Performance Evaluation: Evaluate the performance (regression prediction) of each of the four models.
Compare the performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and any other relevant metrics.
Analyze the results to understand the effectiveness of each model in predicting the target variable.

Usage:
1. Dataset Setup: Ensure that the homework.csv file is available in your working directory or specify the correct path to the dataset.
2. Environment Setup: Set up your Python environment and install the required dependencies.
3. Running the Code: Execute the provided code to train the SVM regression models and evaluate their performance.
4. Interpreting Results: Analyze the performance metrics generated by the evaluation process to understand the effectiveness of each model.
